# Path-of-the-Vatt-ghern-Closed-Beta

## There are two main "objectives" about this test:

Try making a Vatt'ghern with any origin other than my mod's, then take note of your experience of the entire process. Was it fun, was it balanced?
Play around with the Vatt'ghern (regardless of ho you obtained him). Does this feel broken op? does it feel 'earned'. Does it "fit" in the base game and Legends?

## Then there are some "bonus objectives":

There are some secret interactions when turning someone into a Vatt'ghern, can you find them?
There is a new named weapon in the game. Can you find it?
There is also a new event! did you get it?

## Information about the tests:
You can find everything related to the tests in the PoV discord server
