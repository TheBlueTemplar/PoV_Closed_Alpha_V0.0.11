# Path-of-the-Vatt-ghern-Closed-Beta

### There are two main "objectives" about this test:

Try making a Vatt'ghern with any origin other than my mod's, then take note of your experience of the entire process. Was it fun, was it balanced?

Play around with the Vatt'ghern (regardless of ho you obtained him). Does this feel broken op? does it feel 'earned'. Does it "fit" in the base game and Legends?


### Installation:

Download the zip and extract into your bb data folder

Recommended Modlist:
* MSU
* Modern Hooks
* Breditor Legends Version (its great for testing)
* Breditor patch for legends V19 (Found at the BBBBB submod at legends server)
* Latest Legends Version
* PoV, testing version

Of course, you can include some simple mods, ui mods and such, but please try to keep the list short for the best testing results. Also, I will not redistribute any of the aforementioned mods, you will need to dl them yourselves, though you should really have all of them already. I will upload my mod here too in the next days 

### Incombatible Mods:
show named items in locations from the bb legends discord. Did not work for me for some reason, use at your own risk


### Information about the tests:
You can find everything related to the tests in the PoV discord server
